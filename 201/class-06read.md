> # WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

Variables become property in the object and functions become Methods.

## What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.

 It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas:

1. MAKING A MODEL OF THE HTM L PAGE.

2. ACCESSING AND CHANGING THE HTML PAGE.


> THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE

As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.
The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.
It consists of four main types of nodes.
