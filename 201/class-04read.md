Links are what the web is it’s moves you from page to page also connect our website with external websites it enables the idea of browsing.

Try to link and add it to the website we use `<a>` element sure we add the URL of the wanted website or page and truly between the opening tag and closing tag of the `<a>` element we add what we want to appear to the user which is the text link.

If we want to add internal link, we should add the path of the wanted page instead of a link.

Using links, we can draw diagram 2 give users quick learning lesson for our website.

Also we can add mail to as link as below:

`<a href=mailto:tareq.megdadi@gmail.com>tareq Mail</a>`

If we want to open the link in a new window, we should add the target equal to _blank.

In order to add a link in the same page we have to assign an id to the element were we want to move on the page then we add URL using #ID element.

> # CSS

CSS deals with elements as it is locating in a box, this box will be like on block level or in line level.

The block level deals with the main element like H1, UL, LI.
The inline element deals with specific element like image, bold, Italic.

CSS has the following positioning schemes:
  * Normal flow
Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.

 * Relative Positioning
This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.

 * Absolute positioning
This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements (as they simply ignore the space it would have taken up).


> # pair programming<sup>1</sup>
the process of establishing programming consist of two (Driver and Navigator).

1- Driver he is the one who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.

2- Navigator think about the general idea of the project the one who give direction about algorithm and the code he thinks about documentation but not righting any code.


The main skills required for pair programming are:

- Listening

- Speaking

- Reading

- Writing 

## That’s leads to the benefits of pair programming:

1. Greater efficiency:  The efficiency reached through quality.

1. Engaged collaborations: working together is much better than working alone.

1. Learning from fellow student: the experienced programmer can always give directions to those who have less experience and improve their skills together .

1. Social skills: when working with programmer who hold different style of coding the main key is communications.

1. Job interview readiness: this will prepare both of the driver and the navigator for any question for the job interview.

1. Work environment readiness: this pair working will apply the work environment simulation to be able to get ready for real environment.
