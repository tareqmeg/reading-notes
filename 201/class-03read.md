## HTML provides us with three different types:

- Ordered lists

- Unordered lists

- Definition lists

  The definition list is created with
the `<dl>` element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the `<dl>` element you will
usually see pairs of `<dt>` and
`<dd>` elements.

  the `<dt>` element is containing the term.

  the `<dd>` element is containing the describtion.

Nested List 
its a list that follows a one item of a defined list which is sub list in anther describtion.


Border 

we can define several types of borders the box bellow shows types of deffirent borders styles

Syntax | Description
----- | -----
dotted | Defines a dotted border
dashed | Defines a dashed border
solid | Defines a solid border
double | Defines a double border
groove | Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border | color value
ridge | Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border | color value
inset | Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border | color value
outset | Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border | color value
none | Defines no border
hidden | Defines a hidden border
 ---


Margin

The margin property controls
the gap between boxes.

Padding

 The padding property allows
 you to specify how much space
 should appear between the
 content of an element and its
    border.

> # Arrays

We use Arrays when dealing with data that related to each other or lists.
Arrays are most helpful when we know nothing about the number of list content.

the elemen of array are indexed so we can reach any item specifcaly the index stats from Zero until the last element of array.
we can sure change any content of array by caling the follwing 
`Name of array[the index of the element that need to be changed]= "the value weather sting or number".

> # If... Else Statment

it include two block of code if the condition true the first block is applyed if the condition false the sucond block is applyed.

> # Switch statment

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

> ## Switch Vs If statment 

with if statment we can have one block of code with switch we have defult value that run even if the condition is flase 
also if statment cant stop if we have several blocks in switch one the condition is true the break is applyed and the rest are not there.

> Loops 

we have for loop which is used when dealing with exact number .

the while loop used with uncertinity we are not knowing the exact number.

do wile loop same as wile loop but it is apply the code even if the condition is false for once at least.
