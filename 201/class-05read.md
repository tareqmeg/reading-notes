> # Images

when using images we shoul be:

- Be relevant

- Convey the right mood 
- Be instantly 
- recognizable 
- Fit the color palette

> Adding Images

To add images, you can do like the example
`<img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">`
Src, contains the source of the image and tells the computer where the image is, alt, is the alternative text that shown if the loading of the image interrupted, we can also add the height and the width to the image finally the place of the chosen image can be above of the image or at the beginning of the paragraph or between lines.

We should focus on the type of image that we use like JP EG or PNG etc the right type of image is going to be shown on the page but the wrong one is not.

> HTML `<figure>` and `<figure>` caption

We can use the figure element to associate the image with its caption.

`<figcaption>` The element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.

> # Color

In HTML, a color can be specified by using a color name: red, blue, tomato.
We can also set color for the background or the text and the borders.

## HTML RGB and RGBA Colors
n RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.
An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel (opacity).

### RGB Color Values
In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:

rgb(red, green, blue)

#### HTML HEX Colors

A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.

### #rrggbb

Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.

### HTML HSL and HSLA Colors

HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity).

### HSL Color Values
In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:

#### hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
Lightness is also a percentage value, 0% is black, and 100% is white.

>  specify colors

> ## HTML Text Formatting
HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.

HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

• `<b>` - Bold text

• `<strong>` - Important text

• `<i>` - Italic text

• `<em>` - Emphasized text

• `<mark>` - Marked text

• `<small>` - Smaller text

• `<del>` - Deleted text

• `<ins>` - Inserted text

• `<sub>` - Subscript text

• `<sup>` - Superscript text


> ## HTML `<b>` and `<strong>` Elements

The HTML `<b>` element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

The HTML `<strong>` element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.



> ## TL;DR

    Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
