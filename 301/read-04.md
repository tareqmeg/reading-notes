> # Readings: CSS GRID

CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces.

CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance).

Flexbox helped out, but it’s intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones.

To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with **display: grid**, set the column and row sizes with **grid-template-columns** and **grid-template-rows**, and then place its child elements into the grid with **grid-column** and **grid-row**. Similarly to **flexbox**, the source order of the grid items doesn’t matter.
