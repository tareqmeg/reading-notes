> # Functions

It allow the process of grouping a series of  statement  to perform a task.

By calling the function we are reducing the number of  statements  within the same page, this grouping process help organize the code once we open a page the line of code inside a function are not excuted in a way we are storing the statment that will perform a task.

if a function perform the task we can call it a gain no problem.

if you add information  once  you call the function the info called parameters.

once the function return values the  response  is known **return value**.

> # Chapter 11 color 

 Color  can really bring  your page to life this why it is so imprtant. 

  > what we are ging to deal with is this chapter:

 **foreground color**  

 the color property allows to specify the color of the text inside an element.  

> Three ways to specify color in CSS 

1. RGB values  

	These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For 	example: rgb(100,100,90) 

 

2. Hex  code  

   These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, 	preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80 

 3. color name 

	There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: 	DarkCyan 

> background color  

 
HTML treats each each element as if it appears in a box and the background code property set the color of the background of that box. 

sure we can use the mentioned three ways and the foreground color to select a color for the background. 

For most browsers the default color is white, each color is a combination of three colors red green and blue, so if you want different color you can use the color picker. 

> Contrast 

Basically contrast is the difference between the foreground color and background color so when we pick color for the text we should make sure that the contrast is legible. 

> Opacity 

We can describe opacity as it is the amount of difference between parent and child but in colors we mean but there is difference in the color focus.
