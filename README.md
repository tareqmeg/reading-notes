The [growth mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) is to be able to control the negative circumstances that you are going through and to take from them an incentive to follow up. What was confirmed by STEVE HAFFENDEN is that we should not only be happy for ourselves, but with the success of others we have achieved the comprehensive growth of the successful mentality.

> To keep yourself in a growth mindset you should keep in your mind

1. Helping others always 
2. Keep the positive thinking 
3. Be happy always
