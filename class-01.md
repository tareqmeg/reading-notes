In chapter eight we are reviewing the evolution of HTML and we are seeing how HTML5 holds differences between this version and the old versions Furthermore we are seeing different type of elements the global element, the ID element and the inline elements. 


The DAV element and the span element consider to be more likely the same resource or the same thing that contains different description of sections but once we reach the I frame we see that element could add more to our website boy opening a window that allow us to represent another content of another website like we can add to our website Google Maps the location instructions.
