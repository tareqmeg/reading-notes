This element has two main purposes and that depends on the place of the element whether it's inside the article element or standing alone if it's inside the article element this section will be related to the article that we involved inside the page if the aside element is it standing alone this means the subject is related to the entire page. 

> ### Sections 

Section element groups related content together that are related, so it might be inside the article element to split sections and define each section, but if we have a long article, we can use the suction element inside the article in order to determine the or to define each section. 

> ### Heading Groups 

hgroup,  groups contain the groups of headers regardless to their level from level 1 to level 6. 

> ### The figure element
